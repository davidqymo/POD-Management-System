## Current Status

**Phase 1 (Requirements Refinement):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Phase 1.5 (UX Design Deliverables):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Phase 2 (Implementation Planning):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Phase 2.5 (TDD Remediation):** ✅ **COMPLETE** — v2.1 → v2.2 critical block fixes (5 P0 + 5 P2), then v2.2 → v2.3 SFS alignment fixes (2 blocking notification events + 3 P1 service/error matrix)
**Sprint 2 Implementation:** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** — T2.1–T2.5 (Project Management + Scheduler + Gantt Visualization with critical path)

**TDD Version History:**
| Version | Date       | Changes Summary |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| v2.0    | 2026-04-17 | Initial draft from consolidation |
| v2.1    | 2026-04-18 | TDD v2.0 validated: 15 dependency fixes (duplicate sections, FK renames, schema corrections, four-eyes removal) |
| v2.2    | 2026-04-19 | P0 critical blockers resolved: added 3 missing MVs (utilization, overplan, cash-flow), expanded notifications 4→9 events, added `is_billable` to resources/rates schema, added `ResourceService.changeStatus()` + `ProjectService.transitionToTerminal()` concrete signatures, added Resource export LATERAL join SQL, added error code appendix with 13 codes, added Notification Center UI spec (19.5–19.6), added audit partition automation task |
| v2.3    | 2026-04-19 | SFS v1.0 full alignment: added 2 blocking notification events (`RATE_CHANGED`, `RESOURCE_STATUS_CHANGED`), unified `AUTOALLOCATION_COMPLETE` event naming, added Project Reactivation service method (`reactivateCancelledProject()`) and endpoint, expanded Error Code Matrix with 4 additional codes (`CYCLE_DETECTED`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `DUPLICATE_KEY`, `NOT_FOUND`, `UNAUTHORIZED`), added consolidated RBAC Role Definitions table |

All major decisions documented in `doc/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` (v1.5). PRD updated to capture UX decisions from review (Q1–Q5). Technical Design Document (`doc/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`) v2.3 fully aligned with System Functional Specification (`SPEC_FUNCTIONAL.md` v1.0). Design passes dependency checks and is **implementation-ready**.

## To-Develop & To-Debug (Phase 2)

- **Backend API Layer** — FastAPI + SQLAlchemy models for all 6 core entities (Resource, Rate, CostCenter, Project, Activity, Allocation)
- **Project Schedule Engine** — M:N dependency graph, cycle detection, critical path calculation, activity template management
- **Resource Allocation Engine** — availability-based assignment, constraint validation (144h/month, 36h OT, 5-project cap), approval workflow
- **Auto-Allocation Service** — priority-based automated assignment, conflict resolution, exception reporting
- **Dashboard Materialized Views** — 5-minute refresh pipeline, supply/demand aggregation, burn rate + variance metrics
- **CSV Import/Export** — Resource import, Allocation export, Actual Consumption import (Phase 2)
- **Gantt Visualization** — Frappe Gantt integration, drag-drop with constraint validation, critical path overlay
- **Audit & Notification** — partitioned audit log, event matrix (9 types), in-app + email for critical events
- **Admin Console** — holiday calendar management, rate maintenance, resource soft-delete, audit viewer

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Concurrency:** Optimistic locking (version column + auto-retry) on allocation updates
2. **Dashboard Performance:** Materialized views refreshed every 5 minutes (no real-time requirement)
3. **Gantt Library:** Frappe Gantt (MIT) + custom critical path plugin; FS-only dependencies for Phase 1
4. **Timezone:** Single-region configurable (default Asia/Shanghai); no distributed TZ complexity
5. **Audit Retention:** Monthly partitions; primary 24mo retention + archive to cold storage; indefinite retention possible
6. **Rate Cache:** Redis shared cache with key pattern `rate:{CC}:{BTC}:{YYYYMM}`, TTL 1 month

---

## Known Constraints & Invariants

- **HCM conversion:** 1 HCM = 144 hours (fixed, not configurable)
- **Budget unit:** K USD with 2 decimal places (e.g., `4.95` = $4,950)
- **Rate periods:** `effective_from` = YYYYMM string; `effective_to` = system auto-calculated (next rate's effective_from minus 1 month)
- **Project cap:** Resource cannot be allocated to >5 distinct projects in any calendar month (HARD, no override)
- **Allocation semantics:** Override (replace) not accumulate — new allocation for (resource, project, week) replaces any existing
- **Soft delete:** `is_active` flag everywhere; hard delete forbidden
- **Approval gate:** All allocations require POD Manager approval before becoming effective
- **Capacity validation:** Daily 8+2 regular OT, holiday 10h OT max, monthly 36h OT cap
- **Import idempotency:** CSV imports tracked by `import_batch_id` to prevent duplicates

---

## Next Steps (Post-Planning)

_Once implementation plan is created:_

1. **Set up worktree** — `EnterWorktree` for isolated implementation branch
2. **Backend Phase 1** — database schema (Alembic migrations), core CRUD APIs, validation layer
3. **Backend Phase 2** — allocation engine, auto-allocation service, dependency/critical path algorithms
4. **Frontend Phase 1** — project/resource list/detail pages, allocation grid (weekly calendar view)
5. **Frontend Phase 2** — Gantt chart with drag-drop, dashboard charts, import/export UIs
6. **Integration** — end-to-end testing, approval workflow, notification flows
7. **DevOps** — Docker compose (PostgreSQL + Redis), CI/CD pipeline, migration scripts

## PRD Reference

- **Path:** `doc/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Version:** 1.5 (final)
- **Sections:** 1–18 + Appendices A–E
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 28+ checkboxes (Section 11)
- **Total Decisions:** 27 requirement clarifications + 6 architecture choices + 13 BA gaps + 10 technical gaps = **56 documented decisions**

---

## Stakeholder Scope

| Role | Access | Primary Concerns |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **POD Manager** | Full CRUD + Dashboard | Supply/demand, resource assignment, budget oversight |
| **Project Manager** | Project CRUD + Allocation requests | Activity planning, resource booking, schedule tracking |
| **Admin** | All entity management + Audit | Rate maintenance, holiday calendar, audit log viewer, soft delete |

External stakeholder views deferred to future phase.

## Artifact Dependency Synchronization

**Dependency Manifest:** `doc/DEPENDENCIES.yaml`
**Check Scripts:**
- `scripts/check_prd_deps.py` — validates PRD → UX sync
- `scripts/check_ux_deps.py` — validates UX → Design sync
- `scripts/check_design_deps.py` — validates Design → code/test sync

**Git Hooks:** Integrated into `.claude-hooks.yaml`
- Pre-commit: warns if doc changes have stale downstream dependencies
- Post-commit: prints full dependency report
- CI strict check: fails on PRD changes if downstream not reviewed

**Rationale:** Prevent drift between artifacts. PRD is single source of truth; all downstream docs/code must stay aligned.
